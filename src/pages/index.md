Hello!
My name is Najib Idrissi and I am a mathematician.
I am currently a _maître de conférences_ (tenured, research+teaching position) at the math department of the [University of Paris](https://u-paris.fr).
I am also a member of the team-project [Algebraic Topology & Geometry](https://www.imj-prg.fr/tga/) of the [Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu--Paris Rive Gauche](https://www.imj-prg.fr).
I am one of the organizers of the [Topology Seminar](https://www.imj-prg.fr/gestion/evenement/affEvenement/43) of the Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu--Paris Rive Gauche.
You can find more info in [my CV](/misc/cv).

My main mathematical interests are in the fields of operads, as well as in their applications to algebraic topology and homological algebra.
I am especially interested in the study of configuration spaces of manifolds, their links to graph complexes, and the invariants they define.

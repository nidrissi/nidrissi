After a long hiatus, here is the third part of my series of posts about Git for Mathematicians 🙂.
I explain the basics of how one would go about using Git to write a math paper.
If you have not read the previous parts of the series, you can find them there:

- [Part 1: Preliminaries](/post/git-1-preliminaries), where I explain quickly what Git is and why you could be interested in this series.
- [Part 2: The Theory](/post/git-2-theory), where I explain at a high level the inner workings and the data models used by Git.

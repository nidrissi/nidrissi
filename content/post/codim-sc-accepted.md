My paper, ["Formality of a higher codimensional Swiss-Cheese operad"](/research/codim-swiss-cheese), has just been accepted for publication in [_Algebraic & Geometric Topology_](https://msp.org/agt/)!
This paper is part of my effort to try and apply rational homotopy theoretical methods to the computation of factorization homology and invariants of knot-like structures.
As a reminder, here is its abstract:

> We study bicolored configurations of points in the Euclidean $n$-space that are constrained to remain either inside or outside a fixed Euclidean $m$-subspace, with $n - m \ge 2$. We define a higher-codimensional variant of the Swiss-Cheese operad, called the complementarily constrained disks operad $\mathsf{CD}_{mn}$, associated to such configurations. The operad $\mathsf{CD}_{mn}$ is weakly equivalent to the operad of locally constant factorization algebras on the stratified space $\{\mathbb{R}^{m} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}\}$. We prove that this operad is formal over $\mathbb{R}$.

The paper went through several iterations as part of the editorial process.
I am very grateful to the editorial committee for this, as well as to the anonymous referees who provided many suggestions to improve the paper, especially the exposition.
